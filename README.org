  A drawer with my spacemacs configuration: cheat sheets, notes, todos and so on.

** Org-mode Workflow

*** Time management

   *Dependencies:*
   + =org-mru-clock=, [[https://github.com/unhammer/org-mru-clock][github]]

   * =M-m a o C p= (=org-clock-in-past=): Add a record in the past

   *Reporting*
   * =org-update-all-dblocks=: Update all clocktables
   * =org-analyzer-start=: Visualize statistic
   * View today's clocks: =org-agenda= (=M-m a o a=) + =day-view=(=d=) + show clock records (=l=)
   * =org-clock-display=: Show total time next to task (=C-c C-c= to exit)

*** Bookmarks (TODO)

*** Paper library
   * =M-m b f= (=helm-bibtex=): search for paper
     * =Enter=: open file or url
     * =C-z=: help for all actions

*** Task management (TODO)

   * Archiving task
   * Categories & tags & states

*** Notes management (TODO)

   * Linking notes (=org-super-link=):
     - =C-c s s= store link
     - =C-c s i= insert link
     - =C-c s l= search heading for link (TODO)
     - =C-c s d= delete link
 
   * Visualization the links (=org-roam=)

     TODO

** Cheat sheet
*** Basic
    - =M-x command= call command by its name
    - =C-x k= kill buffer
    - =M-m w /= split window vertically
    - =M-m w 0= close window
    - =M-m w u= undo changing windows (splint, closing buffer, opening another buffer). Sometimes it
      useful for magit.
    - =M-m w left/right= move window focus left/right  
*** =M-x helm-color=
    - =C-c n= insert color name
    - =C-c r= insert RGB hex
*** Helm-bibtex =M-m b f=
*** Org-mode
**** Working with heading
     - =C-c C-t= change state
     - =C-u C-c C-t= change state with a note
**** Sparse trees
     - =C-c \= or =C-c /= tag to show heading with specific tag
     - =org-show-context-detail= allows customize how many will be shown for each heading
**** Syncing with google calendar
     - =org-gcal-request-new-token=
     - =org-gcal-fetch=
**** Distraction free mode ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html][link]])
     - =org-narrow-to-*=
     - =C-x n s= narrow to subtree
**** Creating timestamp ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Timestamps.html][link]])
     - =C-c .= insert timestamp
     - =C-c C-c= normalize timestamp
     - =S-UP/DOWN= shift a part of the timestamp under cursor
**** Focus on subtree
     - =org-narrow-to-substree= (=M-RET s n=) focus on current heading
     - =widen= (=M-m n w=) return back to the file
** Setup hints
*** Emacs server
    - =systemctl --user enable emacs=
    - =systemctl --user start emacs=
    - add to =.zshrc= alias ~es="emacsclient --tty"~
    - (optional) add =emacsclient --create-frame %f= to =/usr/share/application/emacs.desktop=
      I don't do that because some packages cannot work with multiple clients (neotree, proof-general).
      Thus in my setup I use emacs server only in the console and open different projects in separated
      desktop windows. Also open server accumulate too many open buffers that disturb navigation by
      the =M-m b b= stroke.
    - setup =initial-choice-buffer= (doesn't work in =master=)
*** Neotree
    - install fonts =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=
    - added hook in =user-conifg= for sustaining state of variables =neo-vs-integration= (maybe it'll
      redundant in future)
*** Private Layers
**** Lean
     - [[https://github.com/robkorn/spacemacs-lean-layer][Follow install instruction from README]]
**** FStar
     - [[https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-layer][Follow install instruction from README]]

** TODOs
*** General
  - [ ] setting up haskell layer
  - [ ] review setting up GPG key
    - add =pinentry-start=
  - [X] fix rewrite =neo-vc-integration= ([[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/10504][issue]])
  - [ ] add hook for =tuareg-update && restart-lsp-server=
  - [ ] saving several session layouts to quickly resume workspaces after reboot.
        (maybe it should relay on projectile)
  - [ ] backup: add saving =.emacs.d/.cache/bookmarks=
  - [ ] backup: add saving private lines into encrypted patch
  - [ ] backup: add saving/copying private icons
  - [X] org-roam: profiles
  - [X] convenient clock in the past


* Notes

** Keybinding convention
    In emacs one command can be summoned in a lot of ways. For example, =org-capture=:
    + =M-m C c= is global binding that came from mnemonic "*C*apture -> org-*c*capture"
    + =M-m a o c= is global binding that came from "Applications -> org-mode -> org-capture"
    + =M-RET c= is in-active-org-file binding for faster access
    + =M-m m c= is in-active-major-mode binding

    So now for me it's a bit clear and will try to keep it in mind for new commands
