* Spacemacs-settings
  
  A drawer with my spacemacs configuration: cheat sheets, notes, todos and so on.

** TODOs
*** General
  - [ ] setting up haskell layer
  - [ ] review setting up GPG key
    - add =pinentry-start=
  - [X] fix rewrite =neo-vc-integration= ([[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/10504][issue]])
  - [ ] add hook for =tuareg-update && restart-lsp-server=

** Cheat sheet
*** Org-mode
**** Sparse trees
     - =C-c \= or =C-c /= tag to show heading with specific tag
     - =org-show-context-detail= allows customize how many will be shown for each heading
**** Super-links
     - =C-c s l= store link
     - =C-c s i= insert link
     - =C-c s s= search heading for link
**** Syncing with google calendar
     - =org-gcal-request-new-token=
     - =org-gcal-fetch=
**** Distraction free mode ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html][link]])
     - =org-narrow-to-*=
     - =C-x n s= narrow to subtree
**** Creating timestamp ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Timestamps.html][link]])
     - =C-c .= insert timestamp
     - =C-c C-c= normalize timestamp
     - =S-UP/DOWN= shift a part of the timestamp under cursor

** Setup hints
*** Emacs server
    - =systemctl --user enable emacs=
    - =systemctl --user start emacs=
    - add to =.zshrc= alias ~es="emacsclient --tty"~
    - (optional) add =emacsclient --create-frame %f= to =/usr/share/application/emacs.desktop=
      I don't do that because some packages cannot work with multiple clients (neotree, proof-general).
      Thus in my setup I use emacs server only in the console and open different projects in separated
      desktop windows. Also open server accumulate too many open buffers that disturb navigation by
      the =M-m b b= stroke.
    - setup =initial-choice-buffer= (doesn't work in =master=)

*** Neotree
    - install fonts =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=
    - added hook in =user-conifg= for sustaining state of variables =neo-vs-integration= (maybe it'll
      redundant in future)
*** Layers
**** Lean
