** TODOs
*** General
  - [ ] setting up haskell layer
  - [ ] review setting up GPG key
    - add =pinentry-start=
  - [X] fix rewrite =neo-vc-integration= ([[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/10504][issue]])
  - [ ] add hook for =tuareg-update && restart-lsp-server=
  - [ ] saving several session layouts to quickly resume workspaces after reboot.
        (maybe it should relay on projectile) 
** Cheat sheet
*** Basic
    - =M-x command= call command by its name
    - =C-x k= kill buffer
    - =M-m w /= split window vertically
    - =M-m w 0= close window
    - =M-m w u= undo changing windows (splint, closing buffer, opening another buffer). Sometimes it
      useful for magit.
    - =M-m w left/right= move window focus left/right  
*** =M-x helm-color=
    - =C-c n= insert color name
    - =C-c r= insert RGB hex
*** Org-mode
**** Working with heading
     - =C-c C-t= change state
     - =C-u C-c C-t= change state with a note
**** Sparse trees
     - =C-c \= or =C-c /= tag to show heading with specific tag
     - =org-show-context-detail= allows customize how many will be shown for each heading
**** Super-links
     - =C-c s l= store link
     - =C-c s i= insert link
     - =C-c s s= search heading for link
**** Syncing with google calendar
     - =org-gcal-request-new-token=
     - =org-gcal-fetch=
**** Distraction free mode ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Editing.html][link]])
     - =org-narrow-to-*=
     - =C-x n s= narrow to subtree
**** Creating timestamp ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Timestamps.html][link]])
     - =C-c .= insert timestamp
     - =C-c C-c= normalize timestamp
     - =S-UP/DOWN= shift a part of the timestamp under cursor
**** Focus on subtree
     - =org-narrow-to-substree= (=M-RET s n=) focus on current heading
     - =widen= (=M-m n w=) return back to the file
** Setup hints
*** Emacs server
    - =systemctl --user enable emacs=
    - =systemctl --user start emacs=
    - add to =.zshrc= alias ~es="emacsclient --tty"~
    - (optional) add =emacsclient --create-frame %f= to =/usr/share/application/emacs.desktop=
      I don't do that because some packages cannot work with multiple clients (neotree, proof-general).
      Thus in my setup I use emacs server only in the console and open different projects in separated
      desktop windows. Also open server accumulate too many open buffers that disturb navigation by
      the =M-m b b= stroke.
    - setup =initial-choice-buffer= (doesn't work in =master=)

*** Neotree
    - install fonts =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=
    - added hook in =user-conifg= for sustaining state of variables =neo-vs-integration= (maybe it'll
      redundant in future)
*** Private Layers
**** Lean
     - [[https://github.com/robkorn/spacemacs-lean-layer][Follow install instruction from README]]
**** FStar
     - [[https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-layer][Follow install instruction from README]]



** Org-roam
    BAD:
    + several profiles is not working properly
    + showing backlinks work not so smooth and storing in db
      (this can be solved by calling =org-super-links-convert-to-super= after inserting link)
    GOOD:
    + fast finding nodes
    + nice ui graph
